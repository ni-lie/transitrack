# Key Idea
The goal of this project is to develop an IoT-based system for public utility
vehicles, specifically jeepneys and buses in the Philippines, to determine the
current capacity utilization of a PUV route.

The collected data will be used to inform users about vehicle availability,
supply and demand, and route capacity, as well as to identify potential stops
for formalization by the government. This solution will help alleviate traffic
congestion, improve public transportation efficiency, and promote the use of
sustainable transportation options.
